Hey-o, here comes the danger up in this club
When we get started and we ain't gonna stop
We gonna turn it out till it gets too hot
Everybody sing, hey-O
Tell'em turn it up till they can't no more
Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball
This is your last warning, a courtesy call
Hey-O, here comes the danger up in this club
When we get started and we ain't gonna stop
We gonna turn it out till it gets too hot
Everybody sing, hey-O
Tell'em turn it up till they can't no more
Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball
This is your last warning, a courtesy call
I am not afraid of the storm that comes my way
When it hits it shakes me to the core
And makes me stronger than before
It's not a question about trust
but will you stand with us
Can you feel it, make it real?
I think it might wash away tonight
Awaken from this never ending fight
It takes more than meets the eye
This war we're fighting it's not just rotting
Hey-o, here comes the danger up in this club
When we get started and we ain't gonna stop
We gonna turn it out till it gets too hot
Everybody sing, hey-o
Tell'em turn it up till they can't no more
Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball
This is your last warning, a courtesy call
